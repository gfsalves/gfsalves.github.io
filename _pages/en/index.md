Welcome to my page!

My name is Gustavo, and I’m a physicist from Brazil. I am currently completing my Ph.D. and will begin a joint postdoctoral position at Fermilab and Northwestern University on October 1st.

My research focuses on the unique opportunities neutrinos offer for probing physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). Several open questions in the SM, such as the origin of neutrino masses and whether neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana particles, are deeply rooted in the mysteries of the neutrino sector. Neutrinos also serve as natural interferometers due to their oscillations, providing a powerful portal into their properties and enabling the application of techniques from diverse research fields to particle physics, an interdisciplinary connection I’m eager to explore further. I am also interested in novel applications, including the use of atomic interferometers in particle physics and the study of decoherence models to investigate hidden sectors.

In addition, I am broadly interested in searches for dark sectors, from exploring the nature of dark matter to probing the possible existence of heavy sterile states. I aim to contribute to the field by proposing innovative approaches to these questions, working at the intersection of theory and experiment, and integrating ideas across disciplines in creative ways.
