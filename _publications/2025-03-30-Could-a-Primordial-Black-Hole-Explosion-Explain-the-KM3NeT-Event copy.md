A black hole is expected to end its lifetime in a cataclysmic runaway burst of Hawking radiation, emitting all Standard Model particles with ultra-high energies. Thus, the explosion of a nearby primordial black hole (PBH) has been proposed as a possible explanation for the $$\sim 220$$~PeV neutrino-like event recently reported by the KM3NeT collaboration. Assuming a PBH origin, we find that the source would need to lie at a distance of approximately $$4 \times 10^{-5}$$~pc, i.e., within the Solar System, to produce the observed event. At such proximity, the resulting flux of gamma-rays and cosmic rays would be detectable at Earth. By incorporating the time-dependent field of view of gamma-ray observatories, we show that LHAASO should have recorded on the order of $${\cal O}(10^8)$$ events between fourteen and seven hours prior to the KM3NeT detection. IceCube should also have detected about 100 events at the time of the burst. The absence of any such multi-messenger signal, particularly in gamma-ray data, strongly disfavors the interpretation of the KM3-230213A event as arising from evaporation in a minimal four-dimensional Schwarzschild scenario.
