In this Letter, we show that pseudoscalar meson leptonic decay data can be used to set stringent limits on the mass $$m_{W_R}$$ of a right-handed vector boson, such as the one that appears in left-right symmetric models. We have shown that for a heavy neutrino with mass $$m_N$$ in the range $$50 < m_N/\text{MeV} < 1900$$ one can constrain $$m_{W_R} \geq (4-19)~\text{TeV}$$ at 90% C.L. This provides the most stringent experimental limit on the $$W_R$$ mass to date for this heavy neutrino mass range.
