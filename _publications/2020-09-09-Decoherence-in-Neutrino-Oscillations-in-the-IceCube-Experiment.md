The discovery of neutrino oscillations established the fact that they are massive particles. This is a clear signal of physics beyond the Standard Model, since this theoretical framework cannot explain how the neutrino mass terms can be generated. Furthermore, because this phenomenon is strictly a quantum one it can be used to study even more the quantum realm. In this work we shall take advantage of the sensitivity of this phenomenon to new effects. Since the neutrino physics has entered a precision measurement era, we expect that such modifications can be further constrained, or even confirmed, with new experimental results. We will focus on a very special kind of effects, the Open Quantum System effects. This is an interesting theoretical framework because it is a predictive description which can also handle our lack of information about the neutrino system. For that purpose we will study the theoretical basis of neutrino oscillations and Open Quantum System effects, discuss how to include both in the time evolution of the neutrino system and investigate how the new effects can change the oscillation pattern. Finally, we will use the public data released by the IceCube experiment to analyze the consequences and also constrain such modifications.
