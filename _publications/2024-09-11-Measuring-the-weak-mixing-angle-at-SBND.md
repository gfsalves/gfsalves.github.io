The weak mixing angle provides a sensitive test of the Standard Model. We study SBND's sensitivity to the weak mixing angle using neutrino-electron scattering events. We perform a detailed simulation, paying particular attention to background rejection and estimating the detector response. We find that SBND can provide a reasonable constraint on the weak mixing angle, achieving 8% precision for $$10^{21}$$ protons on target, assuming an overall flux normalization uncertainty of 10%. This result is superior to those of current neutrino experiments and is relatively competitive with other low-energy measurements.
