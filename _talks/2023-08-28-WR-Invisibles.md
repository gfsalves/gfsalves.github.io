In this work we show that  pseudoscalar meson leptonic decay data can be used to set stringent limits on the mass $$m_{W_R}$$ of a right-handed vector boson, such as the one that appears in left-right symmetric models. We have shown that for a heavy neutrino with a mass $$m_N$$ in the range $$50<m_N/{\rm MeV} <1900$$  one can constraint $$m_{W_R} \gtrsim (4-19)$$ TeV at 90% CL. This provides the most stringent experimental limits on the $$W_R$$ mass to date for this heavy neutrino mass range.
